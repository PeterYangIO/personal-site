                            'When I first heard "Butter", I was really intrigued at how well each section flowed into one another. As I began to orchestrate it, I realized how wonderfully idiomatic the chorus was for an orchestra (0:28) so I spent a lot of time perfecting it. However, I wasn\'t yet sure how to finish the piece off since rap sections do not translate too well into instrumental music. Eventually, I figured out that since it was towards the end, I could write it as a bombastic brass fanfare that carries through to the finish. I hope you enjoyed this cover!'

As Ziqi and I were thinking about potential cover song ideas, we narrowed down on Billie Eilish for having a similar vocal profile and a fantastic compositional style that compliments both Ziqi's voice and my orchestration techniques. I wanted to keep the light piano and subtle backing track featured in the original song somewhere within this orchestration which is when I got the idea to bring on Michael to contribute cello lines throughout the piece. With all this combined, I was able to work in instrumental choices ranging from just piano, cello, and voice, all the way to a full symphony!"

                            "In this arrangement, I included an allusion to the Taps melody in respect for those who lost their lives during the World War. Battlefield 1 makes an amazing point of demonstrating the loss of lives particularly at the start of the campaign where you see names and death years of young men rather than simply respawning. The tragic events of World War I was not completely detrimental. In the aftermath of the war, America found ways to lighten the mood, and thus the Jazz Era was born. I hope you enjoy the little jazzy tidbit towards the end."
