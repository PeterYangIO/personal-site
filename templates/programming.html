            <h3>telehealth system</h3>
            <p>Meeting online with a doctor is more than just setting up a Skype call. <a href="http://urgentcareac.com/">A & C Urgent Care</a> needed a custom built solution that would allow patients to input their information into a system that would seamlessly match them with a healthcare provider.</p>
            <p>This project was built from the ground up to let patients provide medical history and conditions to a provider who would then meet them in a video call and return a treatment plan.</p>
            <p>Expect launch: September 2017</p>

            <h3>Computer Vision vs. Human Conversation</h3>
            <p>Vision API in its current state is rather impressive but we can only get so much data from it. Though it can look at the image and guess what is in it, it fails to make any connection between images. We have accomplished this and went on to compare it to what a user community interpreted it as.</p>
            <p>For our image source, we took top images from popular subreddits and fed them into Microsoft's Computer Vision API. The API would return a JSON, providing guesses of what was inside of the image and a related confidence value. Using this JSON information and many other images, we created a graph correlating images to one another. We would take matching pairs of word descriptors (from the vision API), their respective confidence values, and average it all out to come up with a similarity value from 0 to 1 between any image.</p>
            <p>Next, since we took these images directly from Reddit, we were able to use Reddit's API to scrape the comments from the thread. We analyzed the frequencies of words and compared them to the frequencies of words to other threads and also assigned a similarity value from 0 to 1.</p>

            <h2>Acclaim Academic Institute</h2>
            <h3>website for an international tutoring firm</h3>
            <p>Acclaim needed software that would help them process payroll by ensuring all tutors submitted the proper time sheets that corresponded with the students they were scheduled to. Manual tallying of hours on the tutor and student side took many hours per pay cycle and was very error prone.</p>
            <p>This full stack solution built with PHP, MySQL, and React.js automated payroll while providing a much more user friendly experience for the staff.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a customer facing website was created to help transition this brick and mortar tutoring firm to an online business, reaching students across the seas.</p>

            <h2>Bready</h2>
            <h3>website for fbla website design competition</h3>
            <p>Bready is an entry for the 2016 FBLA Web Site Design Competition. This projected was completed with one other teammate. We were prompted to create a website for a baker who was opening up a bakery/restaurant focusing on marketing gluten/wheat free foods. We took that topic and developed a style and branding guidelines in order to effectively market the bakery.</p>
            <p>This website was created without the use of any templates, built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, PHP, and SQL. We competed at California's FBLA State competition and were named State Champions (1st place). We took it to Nationals and placed 9th.</p>

            <h3>website for virtual enterprises</h3>
            <p>Virtual Enterprises is a national organization which puts classrooms through an entrepreneurial experience. Our class is sectioned off into various departments (Administration, Marketing, Sales, IT, Accounting, HR) to build a virtual company from the ground up. After the development of our company's idea - customizable parties in a box - we worked closely with the Marketing and Sales teams to create this website.</p>
            <p>This project was created without the use of any templates, built with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL. An interesting part of this project is the interactive store page which allows the customizability of the parties with dynamically adjusting prices based on the permutations. We took this website to a state competition in Bakersfield and received 3rd place in the Advanced Website division.</p>

            <h2>Video Player</h2>
            <h3>for live a/v synchronization</h3>
            <p>The idea from this program came about after trying to synchronize premade videos to a live orchestral performance. Tempo by live musicians will almost always have minor deviations from a click track so in order to chance video sequences at set hit points, it was optimal to have a personal manually advancing the clips. The problem with that was that standard video players do not queue separate clips, meaning that there has to be a slight loading time between clips when the next one is called.</p>
            <p>In order to solve this problem, I created a Java application which is a simple video player that loads a video sequence into the system's memory so that going between this preloaded sequence has no delay from loading.</p>
